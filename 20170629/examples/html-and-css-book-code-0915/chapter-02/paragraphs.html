		<p>A paragraph 
		
		
		consists                           of one 
		
		
		or more 
		sentences that form 
		
		
		a         self-contained







		unit of discourse. 
		The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.</p>
		<p>Text is easier <br /> to understand when it is split up into 
		units of text. For example, a book may have chapters. 
		Chapters can have subheadings. <hr />Under each heading there 
		will be one or more paragraphs.</p>
